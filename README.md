Based on but exactly opposite of [codingweekmarketingweek.com](https://codingweekmarketingweek.com/)

See blog post [Coding vs Marketing](https://blog.antarcticsolutions.ca/blog/code-vs-marketing)

## About

This is a simple website that alternates between a marketing week and a coding week.

## Runner

There is a GitHub Action that runs every week to post the new week on discord

To use this, we first need to define the DISCORD_WEBHOOK environment variable in the GitHub repository settings.

Then we need to create a new webhook in the discord channel we want to post to.
